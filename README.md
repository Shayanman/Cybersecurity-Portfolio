# Cybersecurity-Portfolio
I am a highly motivated and adaptable aspiring cybersecurity analyst committed to protecting people and organisations from evolving digital threats. My healthcare background, combined with extensive customer service and sales experience, has strengthened my ability to communicate complex information clearly, build strong relationships, and apply analytical thinking to solve problems effectively.

My core strengths include adaptability, teamwork, analytical problem solving, and attention to detail, which I continue to develop through technical training in cybersecurity, SQL/BigQuery, Python, and data analytics. I value integrity, collaboration, and continuous learningâ€”principles that guide my approach to both professional growth and the protection of digital assets.

What excites me most about a career in cybersecurity is the opportunity to be on the frontline of defending critical infrastructure and sensitive information while contributing to safer digital environments for individuals and organisations. By combining my client-focused background with my developing technical expertise, I aim to support organisations in achieving their security goals, from detecting and mitigating threats to strengthening resilience against future risks.
